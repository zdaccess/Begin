### Exercise 00 – Registration

Before you start creating a full-scale, multi-user chat, you need to implement core functionality and build the foundational architecture of the system.

Now you need to create two applications: socket-server and socket-client. Server shall support connecting a single client and be made as a separate Maven project. Server JAR file is launched as follows:
```
$ java -jar target/socket-server.jar --port=8081
```

Client is also a separate project:
```
$ java -jar target/socket-client.jar --server-port=8081
```

In this task, you need to implement the registration functionality. Example of the client operation:
```
Hello from Server!
> signUp
Enter username:
> Marsel
Enter password:
> qwerty007
Successful!
```

Connection must be closed after Successful! message appears.

To ensure secure storage of passwords, use a hashing mechanism with PasswordEncoder and BCryptPasswordEncoder (see Spring Security components). Bin for this component shall be described in a class of SocketsApplicationConfig configuration and used in UsersService.

Key client/server interaction logic and the use of UsersService via Spring Context shall be implemented in Server class.

**Additional requirements**:
- Use a single DataSource—HikariCP
- Repository operation shall be implemented via JdbcTemplate
- Services, repositories, utility classes shall be context bins.

Server application architecture (client application is at the developer's discretion):

- Char
    - SocketServer
        - src
            - main
                - java
                    - edu.school21.sockets
                        - server
                            -	Server
                        - models
                            -	User
                        - services
                            - UsersService
                            - UsersServiceImpl
                        - repositories
                            - CrudRepository
                            - UsersRepository
                            - UsersRepositoryImpl
                        - app
                            - Main
                        - config
                            - SocketsApplicationConfig
                - resources
                    - db.properties
        - pom.xml

### Exercise 01 – Messaging

Once you have implemented the application backbone, you should provide multi-user message exchange.

You need to modify the application so that it supports the following chat user life cycle:
1. Registration
2. Sign in (if no user is detected, close a connection)
3. Sending messages (each user connected to the server must receive a message)
4. Logout

Example of the application operation on the client side:
```
Hello from Server!
> signIn
Enter username:
> Marsel
Enter password:
> qwerty007
Start messaging
> Hello!
Marsel: Hello!
NotMarsel: Bye!
> Exit
You have left the chat.
```
Each message shall be saved in the database and contain the following information:
- Sender
- Message text
- Sending time

**Note**:
- For comprehensive testing, several jar files of the client application shall be run.

### Exercise 02 – Rooms

To make our application fully-featured, let's add the concept of "chatrooms" to it. Each chatroom can have a certain set of users. The chatroom contains a set of messages from participating users.

Each user can:
1.	Create a chatroom
2.	Choose a chatroom
3.	Send a message to a chatroom
4.	Leave a chatroom

When the user re-enters the application, 30 last messages shall be displayed in the room the user visited previously.

Example of the application operation on the client side:
```
Hello from Server!
1. signIn
2. SignUp
3. Exit
> 1
Enter username:
> Marsel
Enter password:
> qwerty007
1.	Create room
2.	Choose room
3.	Exit
> 2
Rooms:
1. First Room
2. SimpleRoom
3. JavaRoom
4. Exit
> 3
Java Room ---
JavaMan: Hello!
> Hello!
Marsel: Hello!
> Exit
You have left the chat.
```

Using JSON format for message exchange will be a special task for you. In this way, each user command or message must be transferred to the server (and received from the server) in the form of a JSON line.

For example, a command for sending a message may look as follows (specific contents of messages are at the discretion of a developer):
```JSON
{
  "message" : "Hello!",
  "fromId" : 4,
  "roomId": 10
}
```
